## WHAT IS YEET-GIT

yeet-git (CLI command: `yeet`) is a Node.js-based CLI tool that automates git workflows using AI. It leverages Gemini 2.0 Flash to generate Conventional Commits-compliant messages based on staged changes, manages PR pipelines, and synchronizes branches.

## INSTALL

```bash
npm install -g yeet-git
```

## CORE COMMANDS

### yeet (default)
The main command. Analyzes staged changes and suggests a commit message.
- `--yes`: Skip confirmation and commit immediately.
- `--add-and-push` (`-cp`): Stages all changes, commits with AI message, and pushes.
- `--retry`: Regenerate the message.

### yeet init
Initializes the configuration and sets up the Gemini API key.

### yeet interactive
Enters the pipeline wizard for complex workflows (Branch Sync -> PR -> Merge).

## ARCHITECTURE FOR AI AGENTS

### 1. Entry Point
- `bin/yeet.js`: CLI entry point, handles error boundaries and execution.

### 2. Core Engine
- `src/core/engine.js`: Orchestrates execution pipelines.
- `src/core/config.js`: Configuration management (API keys, settings).

### 3. Services (Internal)
- `src/services/ai.js`: Gemini API integration for message generation.
- `src/services/git.js`: Wrappers for git CLI operations using `execa`.
- `src/services/github.js`: GitHub API interaction for PRs and status checks.

### 4. Logic Placement
- New git-specific logic should go in `src/services/git.js`.
- New AI-related logic or prompts should go in `src/services/ai.js`.
- New CLI commands or flags belong in `src/commands/`.

## GUIDELINES

1. **Prompting**: Always summarize large diffs (implemented in `src/services/ai.js`) before sending to the model to stay within token limits.
2. **Security**: Never log or store the `GEMINI_API_KEY` in plain text logs.
3. **UI**: User `@clack/prompts` for all terminal UI elements.
4. **Errors**: Catch all `execa` failures and provide meaningful feedback.
